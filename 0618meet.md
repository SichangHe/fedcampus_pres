# `FedCampus_APP` Demo, Typed-based Advertisement, Simulation Investigation

June 18

<!-- slide -->
- `FedCampus_APP` training demo: integrated `org.eu.fedcampus.train`.
- Advertise different models based on different training data types.
- Investigated simulation using Flower for benchmarks.
- Following up with Johnny on deployment.

<!-- slide -->
## `FedCampus_APP` training demo

- Using Huawei HealthKit data.
- Toy neural net: take 2 input numbers, classify into 3 classes.

## Data-type-based model advertising

- Accommodate training with different training data.
- Client provide hard-coded training type when requesting advertised model.

## Simulation investigation for benchmarks

- The talk with Jiaqi about reproducing strategy.
    - *Tackling System and Statistical Heterogeneity for Federated Learning with
        Adaptive Client Sampling*.
    - Not a big fan: wants me to focus on Systems.
- Set up dev VM Johnny provided.
    - Have to use x86_64 for simulation.

`benchmark_platform` under `MonoRepo`:

- Objective: provide infrastructure for benchmarking.
    Prepare for when we implement strategies.
- Mostly the same as spawning Flower server except for the function to produce
    clients.
- Flower uses Google's Ray for simulation, which guarantees resource allocation.
- Documentation is brief, I will read the source code.

## Problems

- Direction of project unclear.
- HealthKit data obtainment is not fulfilling modeling requirements.
- Technical debt: only Beilong understands `FedCampus_APP` codebase.
    - But, he wants to join the algorithm team.
    - Maintaining members' *hype* is vital.

## Next steps

- How do we make use of `FedCampus_APP`?
- Benchmark system.
- Follow up with Johnny on deployment.
