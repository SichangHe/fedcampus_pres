I serve as a representation for the Research and Practice principle for two
reasons:
I have been consistently exploring and learning through research and practice,
and I have been spreading my ideas in these in an effort to inspire other DKU
students.

Since my sophomore year,
I have been trying to explore and learn via constantly doing research and personal
projects outside of classes.
I find these experiences massively valuable to my growth in technical and communication skills.

I was fortunate to start this journey by joining The Search So Search Engine
Research Team, advised by Professor Jiang Long. Diving into this project,
I was surprised to see even undergrads have the potential to build a remarkable
software project, a web search engine,
by developing programs to scrape the web and index its contents as text.
Besides absorbing new knowledge about HTTP, HTML, and other aspects of the web,
I saw the need and potential for programming massively concurrent and robust
software for web-related tasks.
This inspired me to learn many programming languages prioritizing concurrency,
helping me build up programming skills and gain a much
deeper understanding in programming that I otherwise would not have if I were
only to focus on classes.

Besides the practice on programming,
the search engine project also inspire my curiosity in web programming and led me to many other side projects.
I joined DKU 2022 iGEM team to author the team wiki,
a static site to show the iGEM judges our experiment and community involvement.
During this time, I mentored iGEM biology team members to collaborate in wiki writing on GitLab and
helped them resolve technical issues.
I also stepped up to maintain mdBook-KaTeX, an open source project the wiki relied on.

In my junior year, to explore the forefront of research,
I competed into Professor Bing Luo's lab and soon started leading The FedCampus Team.
Our contributions are demonstrated in the campus-wide federated analytics program and
our research paper *FedKit: Enabling Cross-Platform Federated Learning for Android and iOS*.
Beyond my own research, I often discuss with my teammates, other undergrads,
about programming, time management, motivation, and other topics where I believed would enhance our research and practice.
I also talked to applicants and other students interested in the FedCampus about these topics,
plus brief overviews on technical subjects such as federated learning and web development to help them start their research.

I have spread my experience and ideas in terms of research and practice among a
few dozens of lower-class DKU students.
Some of these students reached out to me,
while others simply started in a chat during activities,
such as running club practice or a meal together.
I discuss how they should learn more at DKU by doing projects outside of
classes, how they can build up their own skills by doing side projects,
how they can seek research opportunities by approaching faculty members
properly,
and how they may think about their career plans in terms of work versus graduate
schools.
