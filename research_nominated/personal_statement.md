I serve as a representation for the Research and Practice principle both on my
personal level and towards the DKU community. Since my sophomore year,
I have constantly being pursuing research and personal projects beyond my
academic curriculum.
I find these experiences instrumental in honing my technical and communication
skills, way beyond classroom teachings. And,
I have been actively sharing these ideas to inspire fellow DKU students.

My research journey began with the search engine research team under Professor
Jiang Long's guidance. Through this project,
I was surprised to see us undergrads' potential to develop significant software
projects like web search engines. Besides absorbing knowledge about the web,
I saw the need for programming languages suitable for massive concurrency,
and delved into learning many programming languages for my hobby projects,
which helped me build up programming skills and gain a much deeper understanding
in programming.

Besides programming practice,
the search engine project inspired my curiosity in web programming,
leading me to various side projects. For example,
I joined the DKU 2022 iGEM team and developed the team wiki,
a website to demonstrate our results to the judges. In this role,
I mentor team members collaborative wiki writing and technical issues. Moreover,
I stepped up to maintain mdBook-KaTeX,
an open-source project our wiki depended on.

Transitioning into my junior year, eager to explore the forefront of research,
I joined Professor Bing Luo's lab and led The FedCampus Team. Our contributes
are evident in a campus-wide federated analytics program,
and an IEEE INFOCOM demo paper on mobile federated learning. Beyond research,
I engaged with teammates and peers on topics ranging from programming to time
and motivation management, enhancing our research and practice.
I also gave numerous FedCampus applicants and other interested students brief
overviews on its technical aspects such as federated learning and web
development to encourage their research.

Concurrently,
I worked with Professor Italo Cunha on Internet Route Verification.
We built a complex parser to decode interdomain routing policies,
and leveraged this system to check for potential network operator mistakes,
which we are preparing to report in an ACM IMC short paper submission.
Not only did I explore deep into the Internet in this project,
but it also consolidated my research direction for my upcoming Ph.D. studies at
USC.

On a day-by-day basis,
I actively share my experiences and ideas on research and practice with fellow
DKU students, advocating for project-based learning and research opportunities.
Whether through formal advice seeking,
or casual conversations during extracurricular activities such as running club
practice or a meal together,
I encouraged my peers to explore their academic potential beyond coursework.
My guidance covered topics such as approaching faculty for research
opportunities and navigating career decisions.

In summary, my commitment to research and practice,
coupled with my efforts to inspire and mentor others,
exemplifies the spirit of the Research and Practice principle at DKU.
