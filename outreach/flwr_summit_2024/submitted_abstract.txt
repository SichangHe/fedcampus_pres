For students, understanding how their health data compares with their peers can be both intriguing and enlightening. Meanwhile, for university administrators, tracking health trends and ensuring students' well-being is of paramount importance. The challenge lies in analyzing and understanding the health data of the campus population while safeguarding individuals' private information and adhering to data privacy regulations.

Our FedCampus project addresses this challenge by creating a privacy-preserving health data platform for smart campuses. Leveraging techniques such as differential privacy, federated learning, and federated analytics, FedCampus effectively balances the delicate trade-off between personal data privacy and decentralized data analytics from smartwatches and smartphones. Incorporated into FedCampus is FEDKIT, a specifically designed cross-platform Federated Learning (FL) system for Android and iOS devices. Developed upon Flower, FEDKIT streamlines cross-platform FL development by facilitating model conversion, hardware-accelerated training, and cross-platform model aggregation. Our workflow supports flexible Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) in production, allowing for continuous model delivery and training. We have successfully launched our project at Duke Kunshan University.
