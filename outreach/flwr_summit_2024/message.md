TODO: Please add some information about Flower Labs and Flower AI Summit.

Steven met federated learning researchers from all over the world.
He was surprised to learn how many people are excited about federated learning,
and how many real-world applications there exist. Especially,
Steven found that many people from outside the fields of computer science,
mathematics, and data science are also very interested in federated learning.

One participant told Steven that the main applications for federated learning
are in the fields of finance and health care;
FedCampus falls in the health care category.

Steven was also thrilled to find some Flower AI Summit participants building
their solutions on top of his work.
Janez Božič from University of Ljubljana told Steven that they built a testbed
for smartphones leveraging Flower's current Android support,
which Steven contributed last year.
This contribution includes a compact conversion helper that provides developers
a base class and a macro,
so they can easily generate TensorFlow Lite models from any TensorFlow models,
which is required to conduct federated learning on Android phones in this setup.
Steven was pleased to know that his implementation works correctly,
and Janez's team was able to deploy their testbed into production with this
help.

Another user of Steven's work is Yusubov Farkhod's team from Gachon University.
Yusubov's team developed a federated learning framework "FedOps" to provide
machine learning operations functionalities.
They recently added mobile support to FedOps based on FedKit's approach.
Yusubov told Steven that his team asked Flower Labs for a solution to conduct
federated learning across Android phones and iPhone last November,
and that Flower Labs replied in January with a working solution.
Since Daniel Nata Nugraha, one of the coauthors of the FedKit paper,
is a Flower Labs member, and the paper was finalized in last December,
it is clear that Flower provided a solution based on the implementation in the
paper. As the team from Gachon University is a close partner of Flower Labs,
Steven is glad to see his work being adopted by well-supported parties.
