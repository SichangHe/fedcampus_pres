What are the major contributions of your
presentation to the area of research?

We showcased our pioneering project FedCampus, launched at DKU. Previous unseen in this area of research, FedCampus is a real-world research platform for federated learning and federated analytics, operating on real private health data from DKU students and faculty.

We introduced FedKit, the solution we developed to conduct federated learning across Android and iOS. Previously, no solution was available to conduct federated learning across Android and iOS. However, smartphones are a primary and favorable target for federated learning because they have access to rich private data. In FedKit, we not only developed a open-source pipeline to streamline the whole process of federated learning across Android and iOS, but also demonstrated its effectiveness by deploying it on the FedCampus platform.

What did you learn from the conference? Please
provide at least 3 takeaways or insights gained.

People are already building on our work done for FedKit. Specifically, the team from University of Ljubljana built a testbed for smartphones leveraging Flower's Android support, which we previously contributed; the team from Gachon University developed their federated learning framework "FedOps" to support mobile devices based on the solution proposed by use in FedKit. This shows that our work is significant and impactful in the field of federated learning.

The field of federated learning has many people interested in it; not just from computer science, mathematics, and data science, but also from many other fields such as health care and finance. Convenient frameworks like Flower lower the barrier to entry for federated learning, making it increasingly accessible to a wider audience.

The main applications of federated learning fall in the fields of health care and finance, where collaborative use of data is desired but data sharing is infeasible because of their high sensitivity.

There is immense interest in developing techniques that make federated learning practical in real-world applications, such as secure aggregation, differential privacy, and semi-supervised federated learning.
