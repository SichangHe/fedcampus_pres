FedKit: Enabling Cross-Platform Federated Learning for Android and iOS

Federated learning (FL) on mobile devices has been a hot research topic because
of its huge potentials in harnessing end user data while preserving their
privacy.  At the FedCampus project, we built an FL platform to experiment
with nearly 100 real users' health data via their personal mobile devices
on a day-to-day basis.  However, most existing "mobile" FL systems merely
run simulations on desktop computers, while the ones that do run on mobile
devices suffer from various limitations.  For us, the important limitations
include the lack of iOS support, proprietary backend servers, and manual
model deployment.  Therefore, on top of Flower, we developed FedKit, an FL
system tailored for cross-platform FL research on Android and iOS devices.
We demonstrate deploying Python-based models, FL training on Android and iOS,
and model aggregation across platforms, all using FedKit.  We discuss the
challenges in FedKit's approach to addresses the aforementioned limitations.
FedKit is open-source, and much of our work has been upstreamed to Flower.
