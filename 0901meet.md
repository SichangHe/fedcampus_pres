## App issues

- [ ] Getting health data
    - âœ… Huawei via Huawei
    - ðŸ‘Ž Non-Huawei Android via Huawei: poor UX
    - ðŸ˜® Non-Huawei Android via Google Fit: no sleep efficiency
        - [ ] New model
    - ðŸš§ iOS
- [x] CI/Git LFS out of quota

<!-- slide -->
## App alpha testing

- Minimum features: no adding
- Need watches
- Need volunteers
- ASAP for iOS

<!-- slide -->
## FedKit iOS support

- Manual model construction with `coremltools`
    - Model different to Android
- Separate Flower server port for training
- (Low hope) ONNX Runtime Training: unified model
