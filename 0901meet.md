# App Alpha Testing, iOS Support

<!-- slide -->
- Beilong: app ready for alpha testing
- Luyao: app needs refinement
- Steven: CoreML training support is painful but under its way

<!-- slide -->
## App issues

- Getting health data
    - âœ… Huawei via Huawei
    - ðŸ‘Ž Non-Huawei Android via Huawei: poor UX
    - ðŸ˜® Non-Huawei Android via Google Fit: no sleep efficiency, etc.
        - New model
    - ðŸš§ iOS
- CI/Git LFS out of quota

<!-- slide -->
## App alpha testing

- Minimum features: no adding more
- Need watches
- Need volunteers
- ASAP for iOS

<!-- slide -->
## FedKit iOS support

- Manual model construction with `coremltools`
    - Model different to Android
- Separate Flower server port for training
- (Low hope) ONNX Runtime Training: unified model
