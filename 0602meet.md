## Plan with Johnny: deployment tasks

- [ ] Map multiple ports to different subdomains:
    `backend.fedcampus.eu.org` and `flower.fedcampus.eu.org`.
- [ ] HTTPS for backend server.
- [ ] SSL for Flower server.
- [ ] Static `.tflite` file serving.

## Plans for next week

- Deploy `dyn_flower_android_drf` with Johnny.
- Integrate `org.eu.fedcampus.train` into `FedCampus_APP` with Beilong.
    - Fully understand `FedCampus_APP` for work later on.
- Coordinate with Aicha to come up with TFLite model for HealthKit data.

## Plans further down

Get `FedCampus_APP` working first.

- Telemetry collection in Android client and backend server.
- Smart client scheduling (need reference).
    - Create custom `Server`, and `ClientManager` for Flower.
- Benchmark system.
